                <h1>MY STORY</h1>
                <p>
                    Hello!
                    <br><br>
                    My name is Cristian-Andrei Pricope and I have a very strong passion for video games.
                    <br>
                    When I was in kindergarten I used to play a lot on the computer we had there. This is how I was raised. I discovered this passion when I started some computer courses in my school. I was around 9. I was spending most of my time in front of a screen playing video games.
                    <br><br>When I got a bit older, around 13, I started searching for the process of making games. I studied a bit and I managed to learn a bit of coding as well. That's when I fount out what I want to study.
                    <br><br>
                    I developed my first game in 10th grade and won the 1st place at a competition in my city. I wanted to make more games but I realized that I need a team. For small games it is okay to be just a person but for what games I am thinking of developing, I would need a team. So I decided to go abroad, study something similar and apply at a game development master.

                <h1>WHAT DO I EXPECT</h1>
                <p>
                    I expect to get better at organizing the items on a webpage, make it look more cleaner. I want to learn how to make a professional website so I can do it for my future games. I want to expand my social network, get to know new people with same interests and maybe this way we can create something big.
                    <br><br>
                    But all of these take time and I try to make small steps, get everything in order and at one point the dreams will come true.
