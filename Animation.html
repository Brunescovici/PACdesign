                <h1>FIRST IDEA</h1>
                <p>
                    For the animation theme we had to create a game. First thing that came to my mind was a jumping star game. For somebody like me, who wants to be a game developer, this theme was the best one yet. I was hyped up and I started sketching the beginning of the game and I also came up with the story plot. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm5fyRxn2Ps">Click here</a> if you want to see the full plot, but basically it is about two stars that fell on Earth and now they need to go back in space.

                <h1>DIAGRAM</h1>
                <p>
                    After I finished the sketch I draw a diagram of the game. I needed to know what happens when the game starts. I needed to know when is the player winning or losing. This is why I had to create a diagram.
                    <br><br>
                    I learnt that everything has to have a diagram. It is necessary for the developer so he knows what are the steps that the user can make.

                <h1>DECISIONS</h1>
                <p>
                    Sometimes you are not sure about what you have decided, so you start thinking that maybe there is a better choice. So it happened to me. I didn't like this idea that much so I started thinking about something else, and I found it. I changed the plot and I started thinking about the design of the game. It was much better than the previous idea.

                    The beginnings are always hard, it is true. But it feels so good when you finally finish the first version of your project. I was not perfect, but it worked as I expected so this was the most important part.

                <h1>MID VERSION</h1>
                <p>
                    After a couple of updates I managed to add some great effects, so the game would look more "lively".
                    <br><br>
                    Working on the game made me realize that I really enjoy developing games and I like improving and adding new features to them. I was always happy working on it. I always had new ideas and I tried to implement everything I could.

                <h1>FINAL VERSION</h1>
                <p>
                    After exploring a lot of javascript and getting a lot of tips from everyone I managed to get to a final version. The plot is the same, the game is still the same, but the graphics are very different.
                    <br><br>
                    I also added some attack-sounds, background music and a settings button to change the volume. I also added more animations to make it more lively.

                <p>
                    I worked alot in javascript. It was not easy to do everything but I learnt more than I expected I could ever learn.
                    <br><br>
                    I learnt how to work with random numbers, how to add sound effects on clicks, how to add animations on different actions. It was a good way to learn javascript, and also animations.
