                <h1>THE BEGINNING</h1>
                <p>
                    This is the beginning of my web development journey. Here I learned how to use the tags correctly. You can see in the screenshot that I used the tag "section" so I can differentiate the topics of the assignment. I also used different tags in the paragraphs, like "strong", "cite", so it was easier to edit the text.

                <h1>CSS</h1>
                <p>
                    I had a pretty good time learning CSS. It was easy to understand and I was so amazed about what you can do with it. I managed to get the right sizing and the perfect position for my items on the page. I worked a lot to get this design and I got a lot of experience since it was the first time I did it and the engagement was way higher than other times.

                <h1>THE PAGE</h1>
                <p>
                    This is the result of my hard work. It looks exactly how I imagined it. I used some pale colors so it is easier to read. The fonts that I used fit perfectly with the theme of the assignment. We had to do a mobile version of the page and I chose the best position for the pictures so you can still see them while you read.

                <h1>Photo Tutorial</h1>
                <p>
                    This photo tutorial page was a big improvement for me. I have got the idea of "clean design". I also learned how to use attributes correctly. You can notice in the screenshot that I have used the "class"  attribute where it was needed and "id" attribute for a single item.

                <h1>CSS</h1>
                <p>
                    In this specific page I learnt how to make it responsive. I have 2 different media queries, one for computer screens and one for mobile devices. Also I learnt how to make transitions between contents on the same page.

                <h1>DESIGN</h1>
                <p>
                    I explored a lot of design ideas on various websites and I realized that the clean ones are in trend right now so I decided to go for a clean page and learn how to implement white space between text so it would look better.
