                <h1>GROUP WORK</h1>
                <p>
                    This theme showed me how important it is to work with others and that it is okay to accept help. We started this theme with a little brainstorming. We gathered details about the company and we had our first impressions written down.

                <h1>TARGET AUDIENCE</h1>
                <p>
                    We needed to find the target audience for this company, so we just discussed and we found out who is it. We got lots of information in a very short amount of time.

                    I learnt that when you are working in teams, brainstorming ideas is the best way to find the better choices. This way everyone tells his/her opinion and in the end everyone is happy but the most important part is that you get a great idea.
                    <br><br>
                    We did a bit of brainstorming and we managed to take the best ideas.

                <p>
                    Besides the video and the target audience, we need a specific persona for our job. So we took all the information about our customers and we combined them into one person. This is how Karen - our persona, was created.

                    After a lot of tries and discussions we managed to get the idea for the video. It seemed a good one, so we gave all we had to make it perfect.

                <h1>LAST DAY</h1>
                <p>
                    On the last day of preparations, we did the treatment and the storyboard of our video. It was not that hard to come up with a treatment since we already had our story made up.

                <p>
                    After we did the treatment it was much easier to come up with a storyboard, we also went to a park to practice the shots that we were gonna take when recording.

                <h1>STYLE TILE</h1>
                <p>
                    We started to work on the website as well. We did the style tile so we know which elements to use and what colors should we use for a website like this.

                <h1>WEBSITE DESIGN</h1>
                <p>
                    Soon we got the prototype of the website ready. We combined each other's ideas and we came with an incredible design. Here we started to see our progress and we became happier, so I learnt that I have to enjoy every little progress that I make so I can keep going.

                    I worked a lot on making the website look like the prototype and with the help of my team we managed to get some cool features like the map from the footer.

                    The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkG2_G34FiU">video</a> was not really what we expected but even though we could not take the shots we wanted, we still had the same idea.
