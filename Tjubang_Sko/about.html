                        <h1>Arauto RAP</h1>
                        <p>For more than 50 years, the Portuguese brand Arauto RAP, most commonly known as RAP in the Danish market, has been the leading pioneer of quality footwear. Based and produced in Sao Joao da Madeira, Portugal, the brand offers innovative and stylish shoes for children all over Europe and North America, with a large market share in the Scandinavian countries.
                        <br><br>
                        Arauto RAP shoes are made to fit any child’s needs – narrow and wide feet, flat feet, small feet – the brand caters all. Every single shoe is handmade at the factory and passes by a minimum of 30 hardworking and well-educated set of hands, which contribute to the quality and the low return rate.
                        <br><br>
                        By using the best raw and chemical-free materials, all which are sourced from local suppliers, the brand is able to upkeep the exceptional quality of craftsmanship. The leather used for production is provided by animals raised for human consumption. Arauto RAP is one of the few companies that solely use water-based glue during manufacturing. Those are few the leading characteristics that make this brand not just ergonomic and stylish, but also eco-conscious and environmentally friendly.</p>
