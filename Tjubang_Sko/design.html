        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>The composition of the website is symmetrical. This kind of composition creates a sense of harmony and reliability. Symmetrical composition also makes it easier for the customer to find his/her way around the website.</p>
        <p>Colors used are bright and pastel to match the warm and soft feel of the shop and the brand itself. The strongest colors contrasts were used to separate some section or elements on the page – for example in the buttons or in the footer section. The brightest colors were used in the places that are meant to attract attention - for example as a background to the shoes. Forms used in the website are rectangular with slightly rounded corners – to further reinforce the soft atmosphere of the website. Rounded corners may be seen in a buttons or in the logo. To give the website more casual feel in the titles and in the logotype more playful, casual type of font was used. This casual feel is achieved by the uneven shapes that this font is made of.</p>
        <p>Logo is made from combination of two shapes – heart and a shoe. It can be displayed with or without logotype. Design of the logo visually describes brand values and their products - company which sells high quality shoes for children and is concerned about the satisfaction of the customer.Colors used in the logo match the color palette. Logo itself was inspired by the flat design style.</p>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>The color palette consists of light, pastel colors in different hues. Such colors are known for their calming and soothing nature. They are associated with the beginning of spring and summer.</p>
        <p>A large number of baby products and brands use a pastel palette. They depict the typical feelings (playfulness, joy, happiness, etc.) associated with childhood using those light color tints, as well as other emotions such as freshness, softness and even romance.</p>
        <p>We believe all those emotions are going to make the user base connect more easily with the brand and its ambitions.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>The typefaces we choose are Chelsea Market (headings) and Montserrat (body text). Both are sans-serif, which give the site clean, slick look. The fonts are modern and easily readable but still evoke a feeling of playfulness in the user.</p>
        <p>Such typefaces play on the typical Scandinavian minimalism seen interior and product design.</p>
        <p id="titleText">This is a title.</p>
        <p id="subtitleText">This is a subtitle.</p>
