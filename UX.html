                <h1>DESK RESEARCH</h1>
                <p>
                    This part of this theme is the easiest one, but also the most important one. It started my string to success. This is, almost every time, the first step of a research.
                    <br><br>
                    I learnt from this that I should not limit myself just at desk research and not everything on the internet is true.

                <h1>OBSERVATION RESEARCH</h1>
                <p>
                    This kind of research gets you some action. I learnt how much it matters that you go and explore the field. I got information based on what I saw, not what anyone else have seen before. The information was more accurate than the one collected in the desk research.

                <h1>INTERVIEW RESEARCH</h1>
                <p>
                    In this part of the UX theme I knew it gets a bit complicated. I learnt how to manage the time for an interview, how to be friendly but in the same time not waste much time on little discussions.
                    <br><br>
                    Now I know how important it is to find the best questions to ask before going interview someone.
                    <br><br>
                    This research gave me the most accurate information about a specific person or company.

                <h1>SURVEY RESEARCH</h1>
                <p>
                    The survey research opened my mind. Sometimes it is good to listen what others have to say. I learnt that if  you are doing something just for yourself, you are targeting a small audience. It is good to take some tips from others and make your project for everyone!
                    <br><br>
                    In this one I also learnt how to kindly share your survey to others and how to create them in order for the one filling the form to actually think about it.

                <h1>PROTOTYPE</h1>
                <p>
                    With this assignment I gathered experience in creating a prototype for a website or, even better, for an applicaton. It is very easy to do, all you need is imagination and a little bit of practice, but I noticed that this is not hard.

                <h1>DESIGN</h1>
                <p>
                    I was astonished when I found this font. I was searching for a good font to be more tropical, more summer-ish. I found this font which, in my opinion, worked great with the fruits. I chose to keep the same design as before, with a clean page and enough white space.
