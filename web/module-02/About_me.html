        <h2 id="First">My first computer</h2>
        <p class="SecInfo">My first computer had an Intel Pentium III with a dual core, and I got it when I was 3 (in 2003). It had an amazing case and it could run most of the newest games at that time. I used it a lot – around 7 years, until I changed it with a new one. I loved that my father also bought this cool sound system and it was 5.1, so a surround system in 2003, it meant a lot at that time. Most of the time I spent was playing games, trying to figure out how to search for them was the hardest part that I had to learn. But with the help of my father and my uncle I ended up teaching them how to use a computer.</p>
        <p class="SecInfo">Sadly, I don't have any pictures of that computer but I can say that it had the best case, and it can be used now as well, that cool it was. The worst part is that it was made for mATX motherboards so you should cut it if you want a good video card or something that requires a lot of space.</p>
