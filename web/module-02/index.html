        <p class="SecInfo">The first computers made were big. Room size big. They were also very expensive and pretty slow and you had to be a specialist to program them. So the president of IBM, Thomas Watson, can be forgiven for his infamous quote from 1943: <q>I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.</q></p>

        <h2 id="FirstPop">The first popular micro computer</h2>

                <p class="Info" style="margin: 0.8em;">A micro computer is defined as a computer with a single central processing unit (CPU) as a microprocessor.</p>
                <p class="Info">Featured on the cover of the magazine Popular Electronics in January 1975 was the MITS Altair 8800 and this started the new era of the micro computer. Limited as it were, it was still widely popular - though mainly amongst <strong>geeks</strong>. The MITS could be purchased as a DIY project, and when is was assembled it had eight switches that could be used to program it. Each switch represented one bit in the memory register and instructions were made one byte at a time. </p>
                <p class="Note">Note: The word “geek” originally (in the 16th century) meant a freak (from Dutch “gek” or Low German “geck”), but from 1983 it has been recorded in teenage slang as referring to peers with few social skills but a keen interest in new technology.</p>

        <h2 id="SoftwareEdge">Software was the edge</h2>
                <p class="SecInfo">In the time of the micro computer software were written specifically for each computer, as they all came with their own operating system build into them. Burned into their microchips where the commands that they understood, and programmers needed to write their programs to the specific machine. The amount of software available for a specific computer played a significant role in it’s success.</p>
                <p class="SecInfo">This is one of the reasons for the huge success of the Commodore 64. With it’s powerful graphics and sound processors it was a perfect platform for games and it gave programmers a strong platform to developed all sorts. Of the more famous ones one could mention: Archon: The Light and the Dark (1983) – A mythical battle chess, Impossible Mission (1984)  - A platform action game, Pitstop II (1984) – A car race simulation, Elite (1985) – A space simulation game, Leaderboard Golf (1986) – A sport simulation, IK+ (1987) – A fighting game, InternationalSoccer (1988) – A soccer simulation, Grand Prix Circuit (1989) – Formula One, Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday (1990) – an adventure/RPG, Creatures 2: Torture Trouble (1992) – Platform type and Mayhem in Monsterland (1993) – A platform type.</p>
        <h2 id="OS">The software operating system</h2>
            <p class="SecInfo">A contester to the micro computer was IBM’s so-called Personal Computer or PC although is was much pricier and did not find it’s way into normal homes straight away. was a much  began to change as the new IBM <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> entered the market. The IBM PC used a software operating system. This had to load on startup, but made it easier to update - simply because you did not need to buy a completely new piece of hardware. The <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> was called MSDOS, this was short for Micro-Soft Disk Operating System (yes, they used a dash in their name in the early days). The code was based on the UNIX operating system although greatly simplified.</p>
